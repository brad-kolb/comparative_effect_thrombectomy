Comparative effect of thrombectomy
================

## Observed Data

There were a total of 5,513 patients enrolled in J = 22 trials. 2,687
were randomized to best medical management. 2,826 were randomized to
best medical management plus mechanical thrombectomy. Each trial was
categorized into one of K = 22 categories according to the type of
stroke patients enrolled. Category K = 1 is large anterior circulation
strokes. Category 2 is small to medium sized anterior circulation
strokes treated in an early time window. Category 3 is small to medium
sized anterior circulation strokes treated in a late time window.
Category 4 is strokes involving the vertebro-basilar circulation. The
primary endpoint was functional independence at 90 days (modified Rankin
score of 0 to 2). Other 90 day outcomes examined were independent
ambulation (modified Rankin score 0 to 3), complete dependence (modified
Rankin score 5), and death (modified Rankin score 6).

The pooled observed odds ratio for all the trials was 2.11. The pooled
observed odds ratios by category are shown in the following table.
